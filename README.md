# Vagrant Workshop: Fast-Track Your Development Environment Setup and Management


Learn how Vagrant will make it easier to manage your development environment setup and remove the "works on my machine" excuse for your team.    First, we will walk through an overview of Vagrant.  Then we will dive into creating Vagrant machines.  You will walk away with everything you need to have Vagrant manage your development environment. 

We will create a Linux and Windows virtual machine controlled by Vagrant.  If time permits we will also create an Azure virtual machine that is managed by Vagrant.

Note - that the workshop will work on Windows, OSx, or Linux machine as long as you can run Virtualbox on the machine.
